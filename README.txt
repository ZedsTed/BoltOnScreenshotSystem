Bolt-On Screenshot System (B.O.S.S.) v0.1.1 - Alpha
This plugin allows you to take screenshots within KSP at a higher resolution than your current screen resolution, using something called 'supersampling'. This plugin will increase the memory requirement for KSP and so therefore is not recommended for those with low-spec systems.

Disclaimer: This is a WIP plugin and there are slight chances that it could destroy the Universe and/or your computer. Use at your own risk and remember to backup your KSP installations!

To use this plugin just click on the '+' in the GUI and read from there. Your screenshots are saved in /PluginData/boss/ and may be quite considerable in size, depending on the supersample level set.
